Welcome to documentation for the JunoCam projection pipeline!
=============================================================

The documentation will walk through the main pipeline to project individual images
from JunoCam and stack them to create a full globe mosaic. 
See the `Projecting a JunoCam Image`_ section for
a walkthrough on the projection pipeline.
